## Data Science Projects

This repository includes all the projects that I did during my Master's in Data Sciences. It consists of total 9 projects.

1. Chatbot - Built Chatbot using Python NLTK library that makes useof bagging og words, stemming and tokenization techniques.

2. Global Mortality Rate Analysis - Python based exploratory data analysis and a pdf discussing the results of the analysis.

3. Human Migration Prediction - Predicting the number of migrants from different countries to New Zealand from 1970 - 2015.

4. Medical Insurance Cost Prediction - Predicting the cost of medical insurance in different states of US using the linear regression model from scikit-learn package.

5. Sign Language Recognition Model - Built a CNN model and trained on MNIST sign languages data for English alphabets. Used OpenCV to real time captuare frames from the webcam video and predict the alphabet with the sign language.

6. Telco Customer Churn - This analysis focuses on the behavior of telecom customers who are more likely to leave the platform. I intend to find out the most striking behavior of customers through EDA and later on use some of the predictive analytics techniques to determine the customers who are most likely to churn/leave.

7. USA House Prices Prediction - Built a Linear Regression model to predict USA house prices.

8. Web Scraping BiggerPockets Podcast data - Used NLTK, Beautiful Soup and word cloud libraries to scrape the data from the BiggerPockets website and create wordcloud of 50 important/frequent words.
